# BrainF computer
I assembled a computer in Logisim out of circuits that runs using the 8 commands used by the esoteric programming language BrainF. I for my computer to have these 8 commands as they are simple commands that ensure a Turing complete computer.

## Specifications:

**Tech used:** Logisim, Python

16 bit address on the memory cell for machine code allowing for 65536 different brainF commands.
24 bit address on main memory cell.
32 bits of data stored in main memory so each memory cell can be a 32 bit number.

## How to use it

Using the Python program you can enter normal brainF code as a string into machine code that you can copy and paste into the Logisim code memory cell ( which is the top left memory cell).

machine code commands are 20 bit and are entered into Logisim in Hexidecimal.
